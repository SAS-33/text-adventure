Hey, thanks for checking out my game. 

- to run it you will need to install python: https://www.python.org/downloads/ , i have included an executable file for you
- then click on my_main.py and run it by pressing f5 and then Enter
- the game gives you options 1, 2, 3, y or n as inputs do not input more than one option before pressing enter
